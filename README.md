Hi I'm Lock,

I'm a student who has interests in coding art and chemistry. I don't have much experience, 
but I am currently working on a couple projects. I have a passion project of creating a database of
chemical compounds and reaction that are interactable and a more important project illustrating the 
cover of "Immigration and data sciences".

You can contact me by gmail, viktor.sina@gmail.com, although I currently am very inexperienced and am only 
working on projects of my own or people I have prior contacts with.
